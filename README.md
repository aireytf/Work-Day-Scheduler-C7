# Work-Day-Scheduler-C7

## Description

This repository serves to showcase my work in completing the Module 7 Challenge of my edX Bootcamp.

This was a code refactor challenge to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the working day:

The application needed to:

- Display the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner.
- Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
- Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.
- Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock
- Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.
- Persist events between refreshes of a page

My finished application was to resemble the following Demo:
